# Preliminary Spatial Feedbacks used to help develop the GFMIP protocol

## About

This repository contains the spatial feedbacks from Figure 2 of the [GFMIP protocol paper](https://essopenarchive.org/users/554553/articles/627762-the-green-s-function-model-intercomparison-project-gfmip-protocol) (referred to there as normalized derivatives of global-mean net top-of-atmosphere radiative flux, N). These feedbacks are only preliminary results used to help design the GFMIP protocol, and should be used with this in mind. Each spatial feedback is uploaded as a separate NetCDF file, with its own grid.

Values are normalized by grid-cell in such a way that feedback values are intensive, rather than extensive (i.e., the value in a grid cell shows what the ocean-mean feedback would be if all other cells had the same feedback as that grid cell). For more info, see the Appendix in the paper.
