# Preliminary Spatial Feedbacks used to help develop the GFMIP protocol

## About

This repository contains the spatial feedbacks from Figure 2 of the GFMIP protocol paper (referred to there as normalized derivatives of global-mean net top-of-atmosphere radiative flux, N). These feedbacks are only preliminary results used to help design the GFMIP protocol, and should be used with this in mind.
